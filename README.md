FFXIV Progression Checker
=========================

*I really couldn't think of a better name...*

This tool is used for quickly checking a character's raid progression in FFXIV. This saves the effort of having to actually go to the Lodestone and look things up. Information is collected using the [Lodestone API](https://github.com/viion/XIVPads-LodestoneAPI) and checks for certain achievements. However, keep in mind that this tool will not work of the specified character does not have achievements viewable to the public.

More functionality will be added in future updates. :D
